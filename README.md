# Data Structures and Algorithms

Implementations of various data structures and algorithms in JavaScript. Each structure and algorithm is designed to provide a practical understanding of fundamental computer science concepts, and were built with a range of useful functions.

## Data Structures

- **Linked list:** A linear data structure where each element is a separate object, linked together using pointers;

- **Hash map:** A data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. This implementation uses a linked list for collision handling.

- **Hash set:** A type of hash map that does not hold values, only keys.

- **Binary search tree (BST):** A data structure that maintains sorted data in a way that allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.

## Algorithms

- **Fibonacci sequence:** An implementation of a function that recursively generates The Fibonacci sequence, and returns an array with the given length of terms.

- **Merge sort:** A sorting algorithm that follows the divide and conquer paradigm. It recursively divides the array into halves, sorts them, and then merges them back together.

- **Knight Moves:** This implementation calculates the minimum number of moves a knight needs to reach a destination on a chessboard, using a breadth-first search algorithm.
