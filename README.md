# Data Structures and Algorithms

Implementation of some data structures and algorithms in JavaScript, with the goal of providing a practical understanding of these computer science concepts in a language where the structures don't exist natively. They were built with functions that allow manipulating their elements in various ways.

## Data Structures

- **Linked list:** A linear data structure where each element is a separate object, linked together using pointers;

- **Hash map:** A data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. This implementation uses a linked list for collision handling.

- **Hash set:** A type of hash map that does not hold values, only keys.

- **Binary search tree (BST):** A data structure that maintains sorted data in a way that allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.

## Algorithms

- **Fibonacci sequence:** An algorithm that recursively generates the Fibonacci sequence and returns an array with the given length of the sequence's terms.

- **Merge sort:** A sorting algorithm that follows the divide and conquer paradigm. It recursively divides the array into halves, sorts them, and then merges them back together.

- **Knight moves:** An algorithm that calculates the minimum number of moves a knight needs to reach a destination on a chessboard, using a breadth-first search algorithm generalized to a graph data structure.
